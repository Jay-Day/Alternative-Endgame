The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza
Ripped most of this information from @Sponsor's original guide, thank you for the legwork my friend!â€‹


Wondering how to get the suave and stylish Lucky Fishing Hat? This guide is not magic, it will not increase the drop chance of Keefer's Angelfish, nor will it influence the Gods of Tastyfish pools from swirling up to your feet.

However, in this guide I will explain:
Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza 101
Getting ready for Sunday
Pool locations
Meeting the fishies
Some Numbers
1. Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza 101

The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is a weekly fishing competition that takes place in the entire Stranglethorn Vale zone.
Once the server clock dings 2:00 PM the tournament begins and pools of Speckled Tastyfish begin to spawn.
The goal of the competition is to be the first player on your Realm to fish up 40 Speckled Tastyfish and hand them in to Riggle Bassbait, who is located in Booty Bay.

Completing the fishing tournament quest (Grand Prize) will earn you a choice to one of the following prizes:
Arcanite Fishing Pole
Hook of the Master Angler
High Test Eternium Fishing Line
But as a twink, none of these matter to us.

2. Getting Ready for Sunday

Things you'll need
Minimum 1 Fishing skill (This changed to 1 in Wrath)
A fishing pole
A buddy to protect/secure fishing nodes (recommended but not required)
The "Find Fish" tracking ability (recommended but not required)
These Waterlogged Wreckage pools spawn all over STV as well and have a pretty good chance to drop Iron Bound Trunks, which have chance to drop the Weather Beaten-Journal which can teach you the "Find Fish" ability which will give you the ability to see pools on your minimap!

3. Pool Locations

Once you have arrived in Stranglethorn Vale you will realize how vast the coastline is. To simplify things for all of you, here is a map of where Speckled Tasty Fish pools spawn:

The yellow line indicates where you can fish when you have a buddy who can protect your twink. You can always solo it at your own risk, of course. There is not a "better" coast to fish on. It really comes down to preference. Western coast has mainly melee mobs, while the east coast has Defias Mages.

The green circle (north west corner) indicates the location of Yojamba Isle. If you are a casual twink that does not have access to high level friends, or you just want to be semi-afk while fishing, this spot is for you!

The blue line is pretty safe for the most part, there are pirates and other mobs at either end but I have fished here without a bodyguard plenty of times and done perfectly fine.

4. Meeting The Fishies

The Three rare fish you'll come across are
1. Keefer's Angelfish
2. Dezian Queenfish
3. Brownell's Blue Striped Racer
These three guys are very hard to come by as they all roughly hover around a 0.1% drop rate. Although these fish all seem so desirable, the most popular one amongst twinks is Keefer's Angelfish. This fish is the criteria to obtain the Lucky Fishing Hat!

5. Some Numbers (Keefer's Angelfish)

Keefer's Angelfish: 0.25% (1 in every 400 tastyfish)

Dezien Queenfish: 0.22% (1 in every 450 tastyfish)

Brownell's Blue Striped Racer : 0.18% (1 in every 550 tastyfish)

ANY rare fish: 0.65% (1 in every 150 tastyfish)

So if you were to catch 100 tastyfish every Sunday (which is about how many I usually get), you would have a 22% chance to get the Angelfish, or a 48% chance to get any rare fish. Personally, I've probably caught around 750-1000 tastyfish, and have found 3 x Dezien Queenfish. My chance of finding an angelfish with that many caught is somewhere around 90%. I shall keep on trying...

I don't see why Blizzard would make the droprates different for each individual fish, so we can probably assume that they share the same rate (The average is 0.22%). With this in mind, there is obviously a rather large margin of error for these rates. This is because there is very little data on thottbot for the fishing competition (only a total of 233 rare fish are recorded at this time). If you wish to help, run thottbot while you farm and upload your data.


Good luck and happy fishing!
