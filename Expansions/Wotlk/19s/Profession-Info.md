As 19s we can get up to 225 skill in gathering professions, 150 in crafting professions, 225 in First Aid, Max Fishing and Max Cooking.
Gathering professions now give stat boosts as passives!
As usual, use https://www.wow-professions.com/wotlk-classic for any info on how to level up any of the professions you're interested in.
Your main profession progression would go as follows:

Herbalism: BiS Do not drop, Lifeblood is OP
Engineering (150) for goggles and recombobulators until you get your Lucky Fishing Hat, then you want to level Mining through smelting or Skinning
You don't HAVE to drop engineering if you use recombobulators heavily or enjoy using bombs in pugs, generally they're banned in Wargames

## Herbalism

## Mining

Leveling this through smelting is probably the easiest if you don't have a main but can be expensive, you can get to 225 through smelting
