KEY

A = Alliance Only

H = Horde Only



II. CLASSES



Warrior - "Spamstring" Warriors do pretty crazy damage if geared correctly and offer the only non-dispellable slow besides wing clip.



Paladin - Great for FCing or for offensive pushes. Blessing of Freedom is amazing at 19.



Priest - Priest is one of the most overpowered 19 classes. Viable as a flag carrier in pugs. Great healing.



Mage - Polymorph is undeniably over powered at 19. Mage is a necessity on any team. They do amazing damage when stacked with fire gear, and have extreme CC potential with stamina / frost gear.



Warlock - Squishy, especially when geared for damage. Extremely annoying class to play against. Much more fun on horde when you dont have to deal with Will of the Forsaken all the time.



Hunter - Come on, its vanilla hunter. If youre not completely brain dead youll be fine.



Rogues - Good damage. Easily peeled unless its a gnome.



Druid - Another great FC choice. Viable heals if geared correctly. Has roots and Nature's Grasp which are pretty nice.



Shaman - Pretty much does anything. Has great heals and purge makes them a real issue for other casters / enemy buffs.
